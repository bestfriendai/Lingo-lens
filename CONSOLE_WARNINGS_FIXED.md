# Console Warnings Fixed
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL WARNINGS CLEANED UP**

## 🎯 Problem

Console was flooded with verbose logging:

```
📖 UserDefaults: Retrieved selected language code: es-ES
🌐 Selected language changed to: es-ES
💾 UserDefaults: Saving selected language code: es-ES
🧹 Clearing all annotations - count before reset: 0
✅ All annotations cleared
⚠️ AR session already active - skipping resume
🔄 Updating translation session - Source: en-US, Target: es-ES
✅ Translation session ready for en-US → es-ES
⏸️ Pausing AR session
✅ AR session paused
✅ Speech recognizer became available
[8:21:18 AM] [INFO] [TranslationService.swift:88] getSupportedLanguages() - Found 21 supported languages
🔍 Loading available languages for filter
📊 Creating fetch request (unique languages) for filter
✅ Found 3 unique languages
✅ Updated language filter with 3 languages
🌐 Starting language download check for: es-ES
✅ Language es-ES is already downloaded
🔊 Speech started for text: "Hola"
✅ Speech finished for text: "Hola"
```

**Plus system warnings:**
```
{"msg":"#Warning Error reading file", "file":"com.apple.CoreMotion.plist"...}
<<<< FigCaptureSourceRemote >>>> Fig assert: "err == 0" at bail...
(Fig) signalled err=-12710 at <>:601
```

### 2. System Warnings Explained

These are **iOS Simulator limitations** and **cannot be fixed** in code:

#### CoreMotion.plist Error:
```
{"msg":"#Warning Error reading file", "file":"com.apple.CoreMotion.plist"...}
```

**Cause:** Simulator doesn't have motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)  
**Impact:** None - your app doesn't use CoreMotion  
**Fix:** Will NOT appear on real devices ✅

#### FigCaptureSourceRemote Errors:
```
<<<< FigCaptureSourceRemote >>>> Fig assert: "err == 0" at bail (FigCaptureSourceRemote.m:276) - (err=-12784)
<<<< FigCaptureSourceRemote >>>> Fig assert: "err == 0" at bail (FigCaptureSourceRemote.m:513) - (err=-12784)
```

**Cause:** Simulator uses virtual camera feeds, not real hardware  
**Impact:** None - AR and camera work fine in simulator  
**Fix:** Will NOT appear on real devices ✅

#### Fig Signalled Errors:
```
(Fig) signalled err=-12710 at <>:601
```

**Cause:** Apple's camera framework (FigCapture) reporting simulator limitations  
**Impact:** None - expected in simulator  
**Fix:** Will NOT appear on real devices ✅

#### FigXPCUtilities Errors:
```
<<<< FigXPCUtilities >>>> signalled err=-17281 at <>:302
<<<< FigCaptureSourceRemote >>>> Fig assert: "err == 0" at bail (FigCaptureSourceRemote.m:569) - (err=-17281)
```

**Cause:** Camera session cleanup in simulator  
**Impact:** None - happens when pausing AR session  
**Fix:** Will NOT appear on real devices ✅

#### Audio Session Warning:
```
Attempting to enable an already-enabled session. Ignoring...
```

**Cause:** Audio session already active when trying to activate again  
**Impact:** None - iOS handles this gracefully  
**Fix:** Already optimized with `isAudioSessionPrepared` flag ✅
